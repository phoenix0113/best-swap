BEPSwap is UniSwap for BinanceChain. It will be the first go-to market product for THORChain and makes some compromises as to infrastructure and trustlessness. It will only swap BNB and BEP2 assets on Binance Chain using a second layer protocol that moves assets around on BNB accounts.

## Project Setup

### Project stack:

- React / Redux / Redux-Saga
- Ant Design
- Styled-components
- React-Intl
- Storybook
- Jest / Enzyme for Unit Test
- ESLint / Prettier for Code Linting
- GitLab CI
- Firebase Hosting

### Prerequisites

```
yarn
node v8^
firebase-tools
```

### Env variables

While environment variables are not required (sane defaults are set), you can configure them. Create `.env` file while copying all content of `.env.sample` and set all needed variables in there.

### Project Setup

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

### npm scripts

- `start`: start local development app
- `start-s`: start local development app with SSL allowed
- `mainnet`: start local development app with mainnet mode
- `build`: build react project
- `test`: unit test with jest / enzyme
- `test:all`: Run entire test suite
- `test:unit`: unit test with jest / enzyme
- `test:feat`: build the project and run all feature tests
- `cy:run`: run cypress tests in isolation
- `storybook`: run storybook for project
- `build-storybook`: build storybook into the dir `build/storybook`
- `deploy`: deploy the project on firebase
- `lint`: lint code with eslint rules
- `lint:watch` : lint watch mode
- `eject`: eject CRA (not recommended)
- `generate:types`: Generate TypeScript types and API function calls for Midgards API endpoints
- `fblogin`: firebase login

Example: `yarn start`

## Generate TypeScript types of Midgard API (incl. api function calls)

All types and api function calls for Midgard API are generated by [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/). Whenever an endpoint of [Midgards API](https://midgard.bepswap.com/v1/doc) has been added or updated, all types should be re-generated and changes are commited into the repository.

```bash
yarn generate:types
```

## Running the tests

To run the entire test suite

```bash
yarn test
```

### Unit testing with jest

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

1. Run all unit tests with jest/enzyme, react-test-renderer

### Feature testing with cypress

To build the project and run all feature tests

```bash
yarn test:feat
```

1. Create a new build
1. Launch test server on http://localhost:8080 with a simple non-production ready file server
1. Run feature tests over the build at http://localhost:8080

### Run feature tests over specific url

To run feature tests against a server set the `CYPRESS_baseUrl` env var:

```bash
CYPRESS_baseUrl=https://testnet.bepswap.net yarn cy:run
```

The default is `http://localhost:8080`

1. Run feature tests pointing to given url

### Run cypress tests against a local development server

To run tests against the local development server use `cy:run:dev`

First in one terminal window ensure your development server is up:

```bash
yarn start
```

Then in a second terminal run the tests

```bash
yarn cy:run:dev
```

NOTE: Sometimes gitlab heavily throttles CPU which can cause problems when running tests over code that does CPU intensive things such as cryptographic calculations. If this happens again I recommend to replicate/debug using chrome dev tools CPU throttling.

## Deployment using firebase

Firebase deploy:

```
yarn deploy
```

## CI/CD

GitLab CI

- Test
- Deploy

Main Branch:

- master
